simblog is a simple attempt at creating blogging website in python+django.
As a programmer, I hate to avoid code ,i.e I don't like all things done on their own with just 5% of programmer's input that is why I have decided to quit django. Reinventing the wheel may not be tactically correct in web development but at least one can get some freedom.
